## üí° About the Project

This project aims to create a minimalist, professional, single-page Curriculum Vitae (CV) designed for maximum readability and accessibility. The focus was on implementing solid semantic HTML structure and clean, maintainable CSS styling.

Crucially, **this project was developed as an exercise from Roadmap.sh's Frontend Developer Roadmap** to demonstrate mastery of basic HTML and CSS structure and styling, serving as a foundational entry for a developer's portfolio. It deliberately uses **zero** JavaScript, frameworks, or external dependencies to validate core skill proficiency.

## ‚ú® Key Features

The following features were prioritized to ensure a highly functional and presentable resume page:

  * **Responsive Design:** Optimized layout for viewing on various screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktop monitors, using CSS media queries.
  * **Clean Print Styles:** Dedicated print-specific CSS ensures the page prints neatly to paper, removing unnecessary elements like navigation or background graphics.
  * **Clear Section Navigation:** Logical use of headings and structural elements to allow evaluators to quickly navigate and locate specific experience sections.
